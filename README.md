## Architecture:

The current architecture of this app is a mixture of Clean architecture and MVVM. The diagram below shows it clearly ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

<p align="center"><img alt="app's architecture" src="docs/architecture.jpg" width="60%" height="60%"/></p>

As it's obvious in the diagram above, in the `domain` layer we define all the objects that will be used in the context of our app (in this example they are `Photo`, `Photographer`, and `SocialHandles`).
The `DataSource` interfaces defined in `data` layer provide functions to work on those objects.
`DataSourceImpl` implements the previously defined datasources and provides a means of data access/control for the ViewModel above it.
